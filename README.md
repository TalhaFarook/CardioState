CardioState: Exploring Heart Health Through Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

Welcome to CardioState, a project dedicated to exploring heart health through the lens of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. This repository aims to delve into the fascinating realm of cardiovascular health by conducting hypothesis tests and calculating confidence intervals using real-world data

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before diving into hypothesis testing, it's essential to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis. This step involves understanding the dataset's structure, identifying missing values, and visualizing the distribution of variables. EDA provides a solid foundation for formulating research questions and hypothesis testing.

# Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals
Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are powerful statistical tools that enable us to make informed inferences about the dataset. By formulating research questions and hypotheses, we can use appropriate statistical tests to analyze relationships between variables and calculate confidence intervals to estimate parameter values.

# Research Questions
CardioState addresses four key research questions:

Is there a significant difference in cholesterol levels between patients with and without heart disease?
Is there a significant difference in genders between patients with and without heart disease?
Is there a significant difference in maximum heart rate between patients with and without heart disease?
Is there a significant difference in ages between patients with and without heart disease?
